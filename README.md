# NASA Project

This project is made with React for the Front-End and NodeJS and Express for the Back-end. It integrates with a MongoDB Database to be able to store and retrieve all the launches created by the user and retrieved from the SpaceX API and Kepler Planets info. With this project the user can add a new launch and check which launches are pending and which have been successful. The user is able to delete launches too. This project also has a way of checking all the launches history including those retrieved by the SpaceX API. This project serves the client side(React) on the same server as the server side(NodeJS and Express). It makes use of Docker to create a container of the whole project.

## Testing

This project uses Jest to test the launches endpoints.
